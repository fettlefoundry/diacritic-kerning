Hello.

This project is intended to create a list of diacritic pairs that might need to be kerned within a typeface during the design stage. This list is not intended to be a complete list of all character combinations – as that would be beyond the scope of such a project – but rather a guide that addresses problematic combinations such as Iî or Iï, for example, as thoroughly as possible.

The current version of this list is based on the character combinations featured in Context of Diacritics [[https://www.setuptype.com/x/cod/combinations](https://www.setuptype.com/x/cod/))](https://www.setuptype.com/x/cod/), which looks at twenty six different languages, including: Spanish, Portuguese, Turkish, Polish, French, German, Hungarian, Romanian, Czech, Slovak, Albanian, Swedish, Catalan, Finnish, Lithuanian, Italian, Latvian, Croatian, Danish, Norwegian, Slovenian, Afrikaans, Maltese, Estonian, Dutch, and Icelandic.

I have taken these combinations and created lists for lowercase-lowercase, uppercase-lowercase, uppercase-uppercase, lowercase-uppercase kerning combinations.

My vision for this project is to add to and update this list whenever I come across a new combination.
